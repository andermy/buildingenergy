# Building energy usage modeling
Energy usage model for commercial buildings

It has so far been proven difficult to track energy usage in buildings from energydata alone. 
The power load pattern in energy timeseries are however visible. 
In combination with simple property attribues, it should be possible to create a energy usage model for most commercial buildings. 

This is an open initative to create a solution combining empirical energy usage data and energy building models to model energy usage.
The model should also provide energy efficency proposals. 

The model is developed with python / pandas.
